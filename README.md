#### The Ask
Given a Design Document, develop a circular wipe animation with dynamically programamble countdown number.

#### The Solution
After testing pure CSS animations, I went with an SVG & Javascript animation. I found an open source SVG class and modified it for this specific need. This prototyoe was eventually integrated into a modular AngularJS directive.
